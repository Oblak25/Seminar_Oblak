This project is a basic Content Management System (CMS) made for a possible bigger future E-Commerce webshop.
This system, for now, has simple Management System that can be expanded upon.

The technologies used in this project are as follows: C#, .NET Core, WEB API and of course HTML with a dash of CSS.
The DataBase was designed and modeled based on MS SQL using "code-first" approach.

Initialized on the GitHub platform with the repository being often updated with new versions.
The Authorization and verification system is handled with a simple login with username and password ( login info will be listed below).
With CMS on this project you can do simple CRUD operations for every: Product, Category and Users.

The index page will show you a simple randomly generated list consisting of 12 products, adjusted with .CSS.
As a guest & basic user, you will be able to access different parts of the web site on the nav bar, such as a complete product list, categories and their individual products.
As an admin you will be able to manage all of the CRUD operations by entering the "Admin Panel".

To start the project simply change the default connection in the appsettings.json to your own ( server address and the name of the database ) and run a "update-database" in the Package Manager Console.
After updating the database, you will find seeded values for users, categories and products.
